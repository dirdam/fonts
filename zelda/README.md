## How to use the font

_Ancient Hylian_ is only a script for the latin alphabet and the arabic numerals, so one only needs to type as usually would.

Both _upper case_ and _lower case_ print the same characters.

|Sample word|Ancient Hylian|
|-|:-:|
|hello||
|world||
|region||
|artifact||
|thermometer||
