## How to use the font

The script used in _Fez_ is only a script for the latin alphabet and the arabic numerals, so one only needs to type as usually would.

- The space (` `) creates a space between words.
- To type the _alternative numbers_ and the _inputs_ type the ligatures in the description (e.g. `1+2`, `t3`).
- If you want to break a ligature (e.g. write "1" and "0" as separate characters instead of the character for "10") insert a `.` or `,` in between.

The font includes **two versions** of the script: the **_boundless_** version and the **_bounded_** version.
- To write the **_boundless_** version type in **lower case**.
- To write the **_bounded_** version type in **upper case**.


|Sample word|Boundless result|Bounded result|
|-|:-:|:-:|
|hello||
|world||
|today||
|understand||
|1 2 7 = 10||
