2. Install the font on your system ( [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1) | [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749) ).

## Font glyphs

### Alphabets

#### Boundless

This alphabet is the one used in the game.

#### Bounded

This alphabet is an extension of the **_boundless_** one. The characters are delimited by an outer frame. This is how we would write the characters if we were to write them by hand.

### Numbers

**_Standard numbers_** and **_alternative numbers_**, together with the equal sign.

### Inputs

These are the glyphs used to indicate which combination of buttons we should press. In this font they have been designed in their _horizontal_ style, even though in the game they are originally displayed vertically. 

The glyphs are named starting with `t` (for [_tetromino_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino)) and followed by their description letter.

## How to use the font

The script used in _Fez_ is only a script for the latin alphabet and the arabic numerals, so one only needs to type as usually would.

- The space (` `) creates a space between words.
- To write the **_alternative numbers_** and the **_inputs_** type the ligatures in the description (e.g. `1+2`, `tS`).
- If you want to break a ligature (e.g. write "1" and "0" as separate characters instead of the character for "10") insert a `.` or `,` in between.

The font includes **two versions** of the alphabet: the **_boundless_** version and the **_bounded_** version.
- To write the **_boundless_** version type in **lower case**.
- To write the **_bounded_** version type in **upper case**.
