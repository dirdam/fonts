## Font glyphs

### Alphabet and punctuation

**Disclaimer**: the ***Ñ**/**ñ***, ***¡*** and ***¿*** symbols are **not** part of the game. I unofficially created them to allow for Spanish typing.

### Numbers (extension)

**Disclaimer**: these numbers are **not** part of the game. I unofficially created them to _complete_ the script just for fun.

## How to use the font

Simply type as you usually would. Use upper case or lower case to choose either the open-eyed or the closed-eyed version.

|Sample word|Unown|
