## Font glyphs

### Alphabet and punctuation

**Disclaimer**: the ***Ñ**/**ñ***, ***¡*** and ***¿*** symbols are **not** part of the game. I unofficially created them to allow for Spanish typing.



### Numbers (extension)

**Disclaimer**: these numbers are **not** part of the game. I unofficially created them to _complete_ the script just for fun.



## How to use the font

Simply type as you would.

|Sample word|Unown|
|-|:-:|
|hello||
|world||
|fields||
|understand||
|42||
